# What is Canonic

[Canonic](https://www.canonic.com) is a free, open-source, browser based on and for Qt's [QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qmlapplications.html) UI language as well as various other file formats.

It is maintained by [haikÃ¼ (Ollie Dawes)]("https://www.deviantart.com/haikuo") and was originally built as a way to make deploying QML applications easier.

A live web app version of the browser is available to try at [www.canonic.com](https://www.canonic.com), possibly making Canonic  the worlds first **browser within a browser** thanks to the power of [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).

Alternatively you can clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/canonic/canonic) and build from source to use natively. 

> - **Important!**  Canonic does not yet fully sandbox content it loads from the internet so only use natively if you know what your doing. See Qt's own docs on QML's [Implications for Application Security](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-documents-networktransparency.html#implications-for-application-security) before building natively. If this means nothing to you stick with the web app.



> A few points to keep in mind:
> 
> 1. Canonic is currently a work in progress and should be considered pre-alpha, experimental software.
> 2. WebAssembly is a relatively new platform for Qt and there is still a lot of work the Qt company is doing to make it stable (just see [here](https://bugreports.qt.io/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=258)).
> 3. As you can imagine, as a result of [1] and [2], there are and will continue to be bugs and lots of them for a while yet. Please feel free to report any issues you run into while using Canonic here https://github.com/canonic/canonic/issues and I'll be happy to forward Qt specific problems over to the [offical qt bug tracker](https://bugreports.qt.io).

> **Disclaimers** 

> **Don't blame me for the bugs:**
> Qt's WebAssembly support is still relatively new and has it's issues. 


originally built as an experiment to test how Qt's [QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qmlapplications.html) UI language would perform as a web standard.



It is currently a bit of a personal project of  

It aims to push the following technologies on the web:
- WebAssembly
- Typing
- QML
- 3D




Canonic is currently 



# Why QML > HTML


Stage 1: QML on the Web
Stage 2: Type everything
Stage 3: 





# Why
- having lots of users is fun
- I believe in the web. It is one of those crazy ideas that some how managed to get pushed through because no one was looking.

- Outside of fiefox 
- KDE made an engine called KHTML for Konqueror
- Apple forked this codebase for Safari. They called their engine Webkit
- Google forked webkit naming it blink for chrome
- Google then made another fork called Chromium
- Opera then ditched their own engine (which was unfortunate for the web as there are not many engines) for chromium.
- Vivaldi, Edge all use chromium too




It was built as an experiment to see 



The awnser to this question depends on who you are:

### QML Developer
### I'm a developer but what the hell is QML
### 

I prefer QML to HTML
