# Creating Links

There are no **\<a\>** tags or **hrefs** in QML like with HTML so we need a differnet method of linking to other pages.

The simplest way to do this is by setting the value of `window.location.href` via Javascript. 
```javascript
// SetWindowLocationHref.qml
import QtQuick
import QtQuick.Controls as QtControls

QtControls.Button {
    text: 'Click Me'
    anchors.centerIn: parent

    // Change url on click
    onClicked: window.location.href = "https://discord.gg/YcsEwdaNbR"
}
```

You can also trivially make a component that changes the window location when you click on some text if what you are after is a replacement for **\<a\>** tags.

## Open a link in the host / default browser

You may want to open a link using the users host browser instead of Canonic if you are linking to a HTML website for example.

Canonic implements the [Window.open](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open) browser method for just this use case. 
Just create a `onClicked` handler for any item with the `clicked` signal then use window.open to load a new url.

Make sure to pass `"external=yes"` for the third argument as it tells Canonic that you want to open the provided url with the users default desktop browser.

```javascript
// WindowOpen.qml
import QtQuick
import QtQuick.Controls as QtControls

QtControls.Button {
    text: 'Click Me'
    anchors.centerIn: parent

    // Open the Canonic discord link 
    onClicked: window.open("https://discord.gg/YcsEwdaNbR", "", "external=yes")
}
```

Before we take a look at how to host our QML files on the internet for Canonic lets take a high level look at how QML compares to the langauge of the web - HTML.
