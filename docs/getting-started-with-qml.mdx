# Getting started with QML

The following is a brief tutorial on how to get started with QML aimed at people who have never coded before or who have just played around with some HTML in the past.

It is intentionally brief and teaches you just enough to progress with the next sections which focus on the things you need to know when writing QML for a web platform like Canonic.

If you want a more detailed and in depth QML tutorial then checkout [KDAB's Introduction to Qt Quick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxyTkXLbcV4&list=PL6CJYn40gN6hdNC1IGQZfVI707dh9DPRc) tutorial series on YouTube or the [QT QML Book](https://www.qt.io/product/qt6/qml-book) if you prefer a written format.
